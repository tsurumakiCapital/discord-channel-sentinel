# discord-channel-sentinel

This is a project aimed to learn and apply software development skills and best practices at a level of a small team, through building a useful small project.

**Description of the project**

We have an (unmanned) channel keeping receiving regular messages from another app. Would like to have a bot in that channel keeping watching new messages, and send an alert email to a predetermined address. This app consists of the following components:

* An active bot installed in a channel specified by the user
* Keep receiving messages in a VM/container.
* Send an email using a third-party service if the message stream is interrupted.

**Practices to be applied**

We classify the practices into the following categories according to when they are applied

1. **Things to fix before starting coding**

    * Preparation: environment setup
    * Coding styles and rules

2. **Rules to follow when writing scripts**

    * Coding efficiently
    * Before each commit

3. **Automate works after each commit**

    * Implement CI/CD workflows and know what happens
    * Automate doc generation using sphinx





## Practices
Here is the detailed list of practices we are going to follow

### 1.Things to fix before starting coding

#### Preparation: environment setup

#### Coding styles and rules

### 2.Rules to follow when writing scripts

Packaging the scripts.
Write unit test for all the functions.

#### Coding efficiently

#### Before each commit

### Automate works after each commit

#### Implement CI/CD workflows and know what happens

#### Automate doc generation using sphinx
